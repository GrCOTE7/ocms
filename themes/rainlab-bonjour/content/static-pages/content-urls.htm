<p>
    This theme has two layouts that use this component, so to test it out you should enable the setting on the <strong>default.htm</strong> layout and the <strong>content.htm</strong> layout.

{% endput %}

<p>Would you prefer to include the language code in the page URL? It is possible to preset the desired locale by using a URL prefix.</p>

<p>For example: <strong>http://yoursite.com/en</strong></p>

<p>
    You may enable prefixes on your website URLs by enabling the setting on the <strong>localePicker</strong> component using the <strong>Force URL schema</strong> option.
